__obsidian__ is a library for algorithmic process design and black-box optimization using AI-guided experiment design


</div>


The _obsidian_ library offers a set of modules for designing, executing, analyzing, and visualizing algorithmic process optimization (APO) using sample-efficient strategies such as Bayesian Optimization (BO). _obsidian_ uses highly flexible models to build internal representations of the measured system in a way that can be explored for characterization and exploited for maximization based on uncertainty estimation and exploration strategies. _obsidian_ supports batch experimentation (joint optimization and parallel evaluation) and is highly configurable for varying use cases, although the default specifications are encouraged.

_We thank you for your patience and invite you to collaborate with us while __obsidian__ is in beta!_

 # Key Features

 1. __End-User-Friendly__: Designed to elevate the average process development scientist. No machine learning experience required.
 2. __Deployable__ using pre-built _Dash_ application. Each class is fully serializable, without third-party packages, to enable web-based API usage. 
 3. __Explainable__ and visualizable using SHAP analysis and interactive figures.
 5. __Flexible__: Handles any input (numeric, discrete) and optionally input/output constraints, multiple outcomes, batch optimization, and a variety of novelty objective compositions. We know that experiment campaigns can have fluctuating objectives and resources, and _obsidian_ is built to support that.
 6. __Purpose-Driven Development__: Impactful features proposed, developed, maintained, and used by laboratory bench scientists. Revelantly designed for process development, optimization, and characterization.

# How it Works: Algorithmic Optimization
The workflow for algorithmic process optimization is an iterative workflow of the following steps:

1. Collect data
2. Fit a model to the data and estimate uncertainty across a design space
3. Search for new experiments and evaluate for objective and/or informational utility
4. Design experiments where utility is maximized
5. Repeat

The central object ob the __obsidian__ library is the `BayesianOptimizer`, which can be optionally wrapped by a `Campaign`. A bayesian optimization has two key components that govern the optimization:
1. The surrogate model: A black-box model which is regressed to data and used for inference. Most often a _Gaussian Process_ (`surrogate='GP'`).
2. The acquisition function: A mathematical description of the quality of potential experiments, as it pertains to optimization. Most often _Expected Improvement_ (`acquisition=['EI']`).

# Usage Example

## Specify Parameters & Initialize a Design

```python
from obsidian import Campaign, ParamSpace, Target
from obsidian.parameters import Param_Categorical, Param_Ordinal, Param_Continuous

params = [
    Param_Continuous('Temperature', -10, 30),
    Param_Continuous('Concentration', 10, 150),
    Param_Continuous('Enzyme', 0.01, 0.30),
    Param_Categorical('Variant', ['MRK001', 'MRK002', 'MRK003']),
    Param_Ordinal('Stir Rate', ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']),
    ]

X_space = ParamSpace(params)
target = Target('Yield', aim='max')
campaign = Campaign(X_space, target)
X0 = campaign.designer.initialize(10, 'LHS', seed=0)
```
